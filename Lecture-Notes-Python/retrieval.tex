\chapter{Clustering and Retrieval}


The \emph{inverse document frequency} $\mathtt{idf}(w)$ of a word $w$ with respect to a corpus $C$ is defined as
follows:
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$\ds\mathtt{idf}(w) := \ln\left(\frac{\cnt C}{1 + \mathtt{count}(w, C)}\right)$.
\\[0.2cm]
Here, $\cnt C$ is the number of documents that are present in the corpus $C$, while
$\mathtt{count}(w, C)$ yields the number of documents in the corpus $C$ that contain the word $w$,
i.e.~we have
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$\mathtt{count}(w, C) := \cnt\{ d \in C \,|\, w \in d \}$.
