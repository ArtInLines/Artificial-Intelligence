    "  - `state` is a state of the game.\n",
    "  - `player` is the player whose turn it is to make a move.\n",
    "  The function call `next_states(state, player)` returns the list\n",
    "  of all states that can be reached by any move of `player`.\n",
    "* `utility(state, player)` takes a `state` and a `player` as its arguments.\n",
    "  If `state` is a terminal state, then the function returns the value\n",
